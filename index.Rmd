### goals of visualization

- show distribution
- compare groups
- illustrate associations


### principles of effective visualizations

- hits you in a pre-frontal sort of way 
- does not use more ink or complexity than is required to ensure correct inference
- has enough labeling to understand w/o context 


### types of visualizations

- ggplot + sf accomplishes 95% of what you will want, especially with extensions
- the defaults are sensible, you can fiddle with everything and the grammar of graphics is best api
- base is good if you want to be extra fiddly rather than just fiddly
- I wouldn't invest time in learning lattice or grid unless you want to understand the building blocks of ggplot for building your own extensions to it
