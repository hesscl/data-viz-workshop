- data: ACS tract data for change over time in composition

- essential: tile, text
- idea: get creative, but be mindful

- what's (dare I say) fun about doing this sort of work is that you can be creative
- as long as you are mindful about why you're using a viz over a table, you can really get off the beaten path
- here we're going to work on a transition matrix figure I recently made since it illustrates how the use of shading can show contrast where numbers by themselves otherwise might induce eye-glazing. 
- it also covers a couple new geoms
